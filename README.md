Also i'm experimenting a little more with the styling of my READMEs

## Aid during this homework
* To be able to succesfully complete this homework i asked during office hours, reviewd repo from freecodecamp, w3schools and MDN Web Docs, and used a lot of XPert Learning.
* Aditionally i got help from a tutoring sesion.

## Description of the App
This so called "task board" is basically an app that allows you to manage task's progess, the colums represent the stage of progress of each task, the intention is for you to drag the taks between the colums to keep track of the progress of the tasks.
